**Abstract:** Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common and
deadly form of liver cancer for which early detection and
staging can be integral to patient survival. Medical imaging is
an usual method of diagnosis, either using contrast Computed
Tomography (CT) scans or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
scans. We introduce a new deep learning model that aims to take
advantage of the information in two different stages of contrast
CT scans to predict the presence and severity of HCC tumours
in the images. Our model is trained and tested on a dataset
of 307 labelled dual image input slices. On testing, the model
achieves an accuracy of 96.8% and a sensitivity of 87.8%. These
results indicate that using a dual image input of contrast CT
scans provides a significant boost in performance to the model.
Such a model prove to be a valuable tool to assist doctors in the
diagnosis and staging of HCC, saving them time in the manual
examination of scans. Implementation is publicly available at link
will be added after acceptance.

## Environment Setup

This repository is developed using Tensorflow 2.13.1 framework in a Google Colab environment. Refer to the Cancer_Prediction_Model.ipynb notebook for experimentation and model development (primarily developed by Patrick Buckley (@patrickjbuckley01).
